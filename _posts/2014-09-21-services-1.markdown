title: Stop Waking People Up
description: |
  <p class="lead">It's two in the morning and you just had an awesome idea that you think your friend will love, but, frankly, it's not so awesome that you want to wake them up with it. </p>
  <p class="lead">How do you let them know?</p>
  <p class="lead">All of your friends are hyper-connected.  Any email you send might sound an alert on their phone, their tablet and even through the speakers of the computer they forgot to shut down.</p>
  <p class="lead">They're not going to love you if you wake them up…</p>
  <p class="lead">Even if they're awake, do you want to risk breaking their concentration at a critical moment?</p>
  <p class="lead">Sometimes, you just don't need them to stop what they're doing to read your message.  </p>
  <p class="lead">It can wait…</p>
